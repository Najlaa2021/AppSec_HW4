Q2)Which of the two types of Intents are more secure?
A2)explict are more secure than implict 
Q3)What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt?
A3)lines 69-73 has an implict intent due to the fact that the data being passed is a url
Q4)What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?
A4) lines 68-70 has an explict intent because on line 68 the activity that is being passed to the intent is a class.
Q5)Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?
A5)the intent in ThirdFragment is proper due to class being passed in. 


In order to fix the issue with the intent, the SecondFragment.kt file needs to be modified on line 71 to point to a class and not a URL. 

An example of safe way to declare intent is   var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
