The vulnerability is located in The UseCard.kt in which the client calls the useCard function in which the parameters passed are card.ID and Token. 
Card.ID is not being validated against the users token, thus causing a mismatch between the current user whos session is stored in the token. 
In order to fix this the backend server needs a mechanism for checking user Identity.
